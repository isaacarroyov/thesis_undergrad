# Summary
Forest fires are complex phenomena where different variables are involved, from natural variables to social or population variables. Different 
perspectives are necessary for a better understanding of the problem, and the use of technology should not be a barrier. This thesis explores 
satellite images from the Google Earth Engine platform. An exploratory analysis is carried out on environmental variables (surface temperature, soil 
moisture and drought) and vegetation indices (NDVI and EVI) taking into account the regions affected by forest fires. Additionally, they are 
compared with other datasets (2017 forest fire record from the National Forestry Commission and hot spot record from Fire Information for Resource 
Management System). In the end, the datasets provided by Google Earth Engine expose the history and behaviours of all variables, being a great 
resource for a better contextualisation of the problem.
